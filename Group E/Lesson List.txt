BoeBot Programs listing:

1.1 - 1.4: THE BASICS, Manipulating LEDs with basic code:
-	Turn on an LED 
-	Blink an LED 
-	Cycle LEDs 
-	Dim an LED using a for loop

2.1 - 2.2: THE BASICS, Manipulating LEDs and reading sensors (in OO):
- 	Toggle an LED using the button
- 	Dim an LED using the potentiometer

3.1 - 3.4: THE BASICS, Manipulating the Servo motors with basic code (in OO):
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds 
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds, then back y seconds 
-	Toggle the Servos using the button
-	Control the speed of the robot using a potentiometer, and change the led based on robot speed.

4.1 - 4.2: MODERATE, Programs using more sensors, and more complex functions (in OO):
-	Drive the robot until the ultrasonic sees a wall 
-	While drive the robot, display an led and have and speaker beep when the robot sees a wall  

5.1 - 5.4: DIFFICULT, Programs utilizing the line following sensors and do more complex tasks with the ultrasonic (in OO):
-	5.0 - calibration program - use this to determine your boebot's white and black line values first
-	Have the robot drive forward until it detects a change in values 
-	Have the robot follow a line using the line following sensors
-	Have the robot follow a line using the line following sensors and calibrate itself (To Be added: have the LED's turn on/off when robot sees line. ex. red led turns on when robot is turning left).
