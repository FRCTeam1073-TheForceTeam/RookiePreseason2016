Baseplate Revision 2 and baseplate revision 2 with pot are identical, except the one with the pot, or potentiometer,
designation has a spot on the left side for a potentiometer to mount onto. If you have a non-standard size potentiometer 
(ie one that won't fit into the roundrel), then use the no-potentiometer file and attach your potentiometer via another 
method.

Phototransistor holders left and right mount to the front of the boebot and hold the QRE1114 phototransistor in place.
These mounts have been added with version 2 of the boebot.
