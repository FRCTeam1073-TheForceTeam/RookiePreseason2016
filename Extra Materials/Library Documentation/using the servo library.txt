Using the Servo Library:

First, include the servo library in your program:

#include <Servo.h> //the .h file extension denotes a header file

Create 2 Servo objects, one for the left and one for the right

Servo left;
Servo right;

To control the speed of the servos, use this code:

left.writeMicroseconds();

writeMicroseconds() is a method of the servo library, use it on a servo object to control the speed

the speed ranges from 1300 to 1700.See below

1700 - full speed forward
1500 - stop (servos won't move)
1300 - full speed reverse

You can also vary the speed - for example, the code below would run the left servo at half-speed forward:

left.writeMicroseconds(1600);

Also, you will need to run the servos in opposite directions, since they are oriented differently on the robot.
