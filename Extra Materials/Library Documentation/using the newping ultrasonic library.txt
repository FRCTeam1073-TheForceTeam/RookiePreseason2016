**Make sure the newping library has been added to the Arduino IDE's local libraries!!**

using the newping library:

first, include the newping libary with this code:

#include <NewPing.h>

Now, declare the constants that the NewPing libary uses:

#define TRIGGER_PIN 12
#define ECHO_PIN 8
#define MAX_DISTANCE 200

Pass these definitions into the parameters of the NewPing sonar() method

NewPing sonar(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE);

All the code above goes before the void setup() method (Since you want to be able to use this outside of a specific method).

To test your sensor, run this code in the void loop() method:

  delay(50); //delay in milliseconds, no lower than 40 so the sensor can measure the return time                    
  unsigned int uS = sonar.ping(); // Send ping, get ping time in microseconds (uS).
  unsigned int cmDist = uS / US_ROUNDTRIP_CM; //calculate the distance, in centimeters
  Serial.println(cmDist); //print the distance
